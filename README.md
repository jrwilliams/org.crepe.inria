org.crepe.inria
===============

A slight modification of Crepe to enable pattern detection.

## How to
1. Open the folder as a project in Eclipse.
2. Open execute.xml and edit the two configurable properties: the location of the metamodels, and the path for where to output the result.
3. Right click on org.crepe.inria.execute.xml.launch and select Run as.. option 1.

You can run it currently without changing the configurable properties - it will transform three example metamodels.
